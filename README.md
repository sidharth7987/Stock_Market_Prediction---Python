# 📈 Stock Market Prediction using Python

A powerful and practical **AI/ML-driven Stock Market Prediction** project built using Python. Designed for real-world usability, this project predicts next-day stock movement, performs full pipeline modeling, and provides detailed explainability with backtesting support.

Whether you're a finance enthusiast, ML learner, or portfolio builder, this project gives you a complete end-to-end system to understand and forecast stock trends.

### 🤖 Built with the Power of AI

This entire project was created with the help of **ChatGPT**, leveraging AI assistance to design, optimize, and document every component—from data collection to model training, backtesting, and explainability.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

### ✅ **1. End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline**

From raw data → engineered features → trained model → prediction → backtesting.
Everything is fully automated.

### ✅ **2. Next-Day Stock Price Prediction**

Predict the next day's stock **closing price** or **price direction** using ML algorithms.

### ✅ **3. Feature Engineering for Financial Data**

Includes:

* Moving Averages (SMA, EMA)
* RSI
* MACD
* Bollinger Bands
* Lag features
* Volatility indicators

### ✅ **4. Backtesting Module**

Simulates real trading to calculate:

* Strategy return
* Buy/Sell decisions
* Win/Loss ratio
* Cumulative return vs Market return

### ✅ **5. Explainability (XAI)**

Understand *why* the model predicts what it predicts using:

* SHAP values
* Feature importance charts

### ✅ **6. Clean & Modular Code Structure**

Every stage has both:

* Jupyter Notebook (for learning/visualization)
* Python Script (for production-ready execution)
